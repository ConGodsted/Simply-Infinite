What is 20w14infinite?

Exploring these random dimensions allows players to gain resources as normal, allowing for all sorts of builds with block palettes that are otherwise hard to get in a default Vanilla game.

*   After downloading the pack, get started as normal. Once you have a base set up and enough supplies for a Nether Portal, write a book, and throw it into the Portal - signed or unsigned, doesn't matter. Going into this portal will create a new dimension based off the seed written in the book.
*   Something to try: There's 43 hard coded [Easter Egg dimensions](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_20w14%E2%88%9E#World_generation). Try using the names of these dimensions as your dimensional seed, a great one to get started with is the 'library' dimension.
